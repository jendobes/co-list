bundle exec rails s -p 3001


in coliving and coworking card components, pass down the entire list of cospaces and loop through each to render
the individual profile in the component, then wrap the listed profiles in a div so they can be inline-bound
and look like boxes, three to a row.

each box should be equal, if about text is over a certain length truncate it

pages need images and styling
